# Internal Developer Platform

An [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/) (IDP) is built by a platform team to build golden paths and enable developer self-service.

### Why a client?

Internal developer portals serve as the interface through which developers can discover and access internal developer platform capabilities.

Separating the client from the service allows us to make sure they move independently.

## Client

The client is broken down to different commands.

### Pipeline

```shell
‚ùØ ./idpctl pipeline --help
Manage pipelines.

Usage:
  idpctl pipeline [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --create string    create a pipeline (path to file)
  -d, --delete string    delete a pipeline (the id of the pipeline)
  -g, --get string       retrieve a pipeline (the id of the pipeline)
  -h, --help             help for pipeline
  -t, --trigger string   trigger a pipeline (the id of the pipeline)
  -u, --update string    update a pipeline (id of the pipeline and the path to file, e.g. id:path)

Global Flags:
  -i, --input string   input config location (format kind:location)
```

Check out the [Makefile](Makefile) to see how you can use it from there.
